A tsunami is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a [large lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunamis_in_lakes). [Earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake), [volcanic eruptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions) and other [underwater explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_explosion) (including detonations, landslides, [glacier calvings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_calving), [meteorite impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event) and other disturbances) above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami.[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami#cite_note-5) Unlike normal [ocean waves, which are generated by wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave), or [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide), which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water.

Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or [sea waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave) because their wavelength is far longer.[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami#cite_note-6) Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising [tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide).[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami#cite_note-7) For this reason, it is often referred to as a "tidal wave", although this usage is not favored by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis.
