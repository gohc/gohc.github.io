Tropical cyclones are areas of relatively [low pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area) in the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere), with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at [sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level). The environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as "warm core" systems
