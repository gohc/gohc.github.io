# Formation and Evolution of Our Solar System 

## Wikipedia has an excellent and extensive  section on this topic.

“The formation and evolution of the Solar System began 4.5 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud.  Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a proto-planetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids and other small solar system bodies formed.”  The image to the right is from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array of the young star HL Tauri showing examples of the protoplanetary disk.

“The solar system has evolved considerably since its initial formation.  Many moons have formed from the circling lists of gas and dust around their own parent planets.  While other moons are believed to have formed independently and later been captured by their current planets.  Still others, such as the Earth’s moon, may be the result of giant collisions.  Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System.  The positions of the planets might have been shifted due to gravitational interactions.   This planetary migration is thought to have been responsible for much of the early evolution of our solar system.” From Wikipedia….

## Terrestrial Planets - More work needed here
Terrestrial planets are those without large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They form via the pairwise accretion of solid particles, which endows them with a specific composition, e.g. relative water content. The terrestrial planets in our Solar System likely formed from local material, but in other planetary systems they may form elsewhere and move considerable distances before the gaseous disk disperses. Planets’ orbits can change over time due to gravitational pulls from other planets, which in turns changes their climates as the planet-star distance changes.

Nearly every star in the galaxy is orbited by at least one planet, with the vast majority terrestrial. Many known planets are larger than Earth, but smaller than Neptune, and astronomers are still not certain where the dividing line between terrestrial planets and gas giants lies. 

Habitable planets are those that contain liquid water, a power source, and the “bioessential elements” of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.  The liquid water may reside on a solid surface (like Earth), or in a layer below the solid surface (like Jupiter’s moon Europa). Stellar nucleosynthesis generates large amounts of the bioessential elements, stars provide energy, and water is one of the most common molecules in the galaxy. Thus, habitable conditions may be present throughout the universe in the environments around stars.
