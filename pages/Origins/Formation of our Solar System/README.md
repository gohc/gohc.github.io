# Formation and Evolution of Our Solar System 
Wikipedia has an excellent and extensive  section on this topic.

#### “The formation and evolution of the Solar System began 4.5 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud.  Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a proto-planetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids and other small solar system bodies formed.”  The image to the right is from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array of the young star HL Tauri showing examples of the protoplanetary disk.

#### “The solar system has evolved considerably since its initial formation.  Many moons have formed from the circling lists of gas and dust around their own parent planets.  While other moons are believed to have formed independently and later been captured by their current planets.  Still others, such as the Earth’s moon, may be the result of giant collisions.  Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System.  The positions of the planets might have been shifted due to gravitational interactions.   This planetary migration is thought to have been responsible for much of the early evolution of our solar system.” From Wikipedia….
