# Plate Tectonics and the Evolution of the Seafloor

The best development of “Plate Tectonics: Evolution of the Seafloor” that I am aware of, is the open-source textbook by Douglas A. Segar (2018).  Chapter 4 of that source has the title in quotes as above and is well explained and extraordinarily well illustrated.  The link to a pdf version of that chapter is here:  https://reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4Chap04.pdf   Comment by JRDelaney
Figure 4-10 of the Segar Reference is shown below and must be credited to his effort.
