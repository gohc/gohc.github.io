# Our Naked Ocean - https://marinebio.org/oceans/history/

The Ocean is not just where the land happens to be covered by water.  The sea floor i geologically distinct from the continents.  It is locked in a  perpetual cycle of birth and destruction that shapes the ocean and controls much of geology and geological history of the continents.
Unique in our Solar System, the earth’s liquid ocean is exposed directly to space, hence “naked”.  It covers 72% of the earths surface .  It is not distributed equally with respect to the equator.  About two-thirds of the earth’s land area is found in the northern Hemisphere, which i only about 61% ocean, about 80% of the southern Hemisphere is ocean.
