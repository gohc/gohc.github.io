# Galaxies and Black Holes
Galaxies are vast cosmic island of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity.  Edwin Hubble’s keen eye has revealed intricate details of the shapes, structures, and histories of galaxies - whether alone,, as part of small groups, or within immense clusters.  From supermassive black holes at galactic centers, to giant burts of star formation to titanic collisions between galaxies, these discoveries allow astronomers to prob the current properties of galaxies as well as examine how they formed and develop over time.

### Black Holes - 
A black hole is a region of space where the pulling force of gravity is so strong that light is not able to escape.  The strong gravity occurs because matter has been pressed into a tiny space.  This compression can take place at the end of a star’s life.   Some black holes are the result of dying stars. Because no light can escape, black holes are invisible. However, space telescopes with special instruments can help find black holes.  They can observe the behavior of material and stars that are very close to black holes.  https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-58.html

### Galactic Seeds
Every large galaxy in the universe is likely ‘anchored’ to a central supermassive [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole).  Deciphering the ways in which those anchors pirouette could offer clues to how they, and their host galaxies formed  and evolved over the age of the Universe.
“One of the things we don’t know is how supermassive black holes form,” says William Alston of Cambridge University, “ What are the seeds of these in the early universe? Most of our models currently predict seeds that are too small, and they can’t grow quick enough.”
