### The Institute of Physics provides a simple well illustrated video of the manner by which Stars come into existence and eventually either disappear or explode and leave behind a neutron star or a black hole.  The long-lived stars at about the size of our Sun often survive for 10 billion years, and develop planets from a protocolar disk of dust and tiny planetesimals.  Eventually, even our star will explode when it runs out of Hydrogen fuel to feed the solar furnace via fusion to become Helium atoms.  

### NASA Science - Universe - Stars  https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve   Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects and represent the most fundamental blocks of galaxies.  The age, distribution, and composition of stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that Galaxy.  Also, Stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them.
