Clear explanation of the concept by Neil de Grasse Tyson in a 7 minute video  The Big Bang Model is a widely held theory of the evolution of the universe.  Its essential feature is the emergence of the universe from a state extremely high temperature and density - the so-called big bang that occurred 13.8 years ago.  Although this type of universe was proposed by Russian Mathematician Aleksandr Friedmann and belgian astronomer Georges Lemaitre in the 1920, the modern version was developed by Russian-born American physicist George Gamow and colleagues in the 1940’s

## Big Bang - Origin of the Universe: Development of the Big-Bang Theory
Georges Lemaitre, a Belgian Physicist and Cleric, treated the Doppler shifts in spiral nebulae as evidence of a cosmic expansion and published a seminal paper in an obscure journal. The paper was entitled “A Homogeneous Universe of Constant Mass and Growing Radius……”in 1927.

## Stellar Nucleosynthesis
How stars make all the elements - by Anderson Jones, 2019.  
Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which elements are created within stars by combining the protons and neutrons together from the nuclei of lighter elements. All of the atoms in the universe began as hydrogen. Fusion inside stars transforms hydrogen into helium, heat, and radiation. Heavier elements are created in different types of stars as they die or explode.
