# Mythologies

The twenty-first century looks down upon a world without mystery. The abilities of modern science and technology have gradually debunked the plethora of myths and legends borne out of wonder in our illusive world. Yet vibrant legends and mythologies remain important windows into the past that allow us to understand the age-old relationship between humans and the natural world. 
 
For centuries, the Ocean has occupied our wildest imaginations. Across the world's cultures, there is a shared perception of the Ocean as a place of both incredible majesty and terror. In its illusive waters, countless ships and great captains were lost to infamous creatures of the deep. Sea serpents and monsters lurked in its sepulchral depths, rising to the surface to remind dauntless explorers of the indomitable nature of the Ocean. Contrasting these myths, are stories ripe with elements of beauty, life, and romanticism. These are the stories of creation, merfolk, and kingdoms of unfathomable wealth.
 
Myths tell us how people made sense of a world before mathematical and geophysical explanations. Even while modern technologies have demystified the wonders of our mundus subterraneus, the cultural, moral, and emotional meanings that these myths embody persist into the modern day.
