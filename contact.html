          John Delaney's passion is for the global ocean, the ultimate life-support system of the planet. Since 1997, he has directed development of the regional cabled ocean observatory that evolved from NEPTUNE into the Regional Scale Nodes (RSN) program within the National Science Foundation's Ocean Observatories Initiative. He leads the University of Washington team of scientists and engineers who are designing, building, and installing this first U.S. regional cabled ocean observatory. The RSN network of cables, instruments, sensors, and moorings will enable adaptive, real-time interactive research on energetic and episodic natural phenomena operating throughout the world's oceans. Delaney presents public lectures and talks (TED) in venues around the world on the potential of new technologies to revolutionize ocean science and education.</p>

        <p>Sulc’s penguin research contributed to her senior thesis in oceanography, looking at phytoplankton productivity in relation to penguin foraging patterns. She completed an honors thesis for her French major as well, working with Professor Geoffrey Turnovsky. Sulc wrote a series of computer scripts in Python, a programming language, to extract names mentioned in correspondence. Using this data, she was able to generate a digital map of the literary circles that had long fascinated her. The digital humanities methods Sulc used for her research were similar to those she uses in the sciences. “I started looking at the literary circles as if they were an ecosystem, studying the different levels and interactions between people in the same way I would study predators and prey,” she says.</p>

      <p>From summit to seafloor - Friedrich is passionate about using modern data science techniques to better understand the ever changing state of Earth's hydrosphere and its fate as the fundamental life support system on Earth. Prior to embarking on a PhD at University of Washington, Friedrich spent three years at Rutgers University working with UW's Applied Physics Lab to evaluate data streaming from the RSN Cabled Array, a distributed seafloor sensor network delivering real-time insight into geological, physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in the ocean at this very moment. His current PhD research focuses on looking back in time, by reconstructing the 3D evolution of mountain glaciers in response to climate forcing, using historical aerial photography and satellite imagery collected over the past century.</p>

      <p>Erik is a PhD candidate in the School of Oceanography at UW, where he is immersed in the world of seafloor geodetics, studying how the solid earth deforms in settings like offshore subduction zones and undersea volcanoes. This field goes hand-in-hand with the exploration of new technologies and techniques necessary for obtaining high-resolution measurements in the presence of complex ocean circulation signals. He is particularly interested in how offshore deformation fits into the earthquake cycle and the occurrence of damaging M9 earthquakes -- a looming hazard in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
