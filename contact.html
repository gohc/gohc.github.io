          John Delaney's passion is for the global ocean, the ultimate life-support system of the planet. Since 1997, he has directed development of the regional cabled ocean observatory that evolved from NEPTUNE into the Regional Scale Nodes (RSN) program within the National Science Foundation's Ocean Observatories Initiative. He leads the University of Washington team of scientists and engineers who are designing, building, and installing this first U.S. regional cabled ocean observatory. The RSN network of cables, instruments, sensors, and moorings will enable adaptive, real-time interactive research on energetic and episodic natural phenomena operating throughout the world's oceans. Delaney presents public lectures and talks (TED) in venues around the world on the potential of new technologies to revolutionize ocean science and education.</p>

        <p>Sulc’s penguin research contributed to her senior thesis in oceanography, looking at phytoplankton productivity in relation to penguin foraging patterns. She completed an honors thesis for her French major as well, working with Professor Geoffrey Turnovsky. Sulc wrote a series of computer scripts in Python, a programming language, to extract names mentioned in correspondence. Using this data, she was able to generate a digital map of the literary circles that had long fascinated her. The digital humanities methods Sulc used for her research were similar to those she uses in the sciences. “I started looking at the literary circles as if they were an ecosystem, studying the different levels and interactions between people in the same way I would study predators and prey,” she says.</p>

      <p>Earth’s Global Ocean is central to the well-being of every human whether
        they know it or not. Tiny plants in the surface ocean produce half the oxygen
        we breathe. Oceans modulate planetary and regional environments influencing
        production of food on land. With modern infrastructure, the Ocean
        fundamentally underpins global economies and national defenses. Yet, rapidly
        
        expanding human activities threaten the viability of this vulnerable Human-
        Ocean linkage. We seek to expand these, and many other themes, to launch a
        
        vastly broader global awareness of the crucial balance between human benefits
        and human degradation of our Ocean-Earth System.</p>
