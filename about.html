        <h2> WHY?</h2>
        <a >Earth’s Global Ocean is central to the well-being of every human whether they know it or not. Tiny plants in the surface ocean produce half the oxygen we breathe. Oceans modulate planetary and regional environments influencing production of food on land. With modern infrastructure, the Ocean fundamentally underpins global economies and national defenses. Yet, rapidly expanding human activities threaten the viability of this vulnerable Human- Ocean linkage. We seek to expand these, and many other themes, to launch a vastly broader global awareness of the crucial balance between human benefits and human degradation of our Ocean-Earth System.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> HOW?</h2>
        <a>Our approach involves sharing with everyone on earth, in accessible and captivating ‘languages’, the myriad interactions humans and oceans have had, do have, and may yet have in a well-crafted future. Powerful oceanic influences in human history, trade, commerce, living and non-living resources, hazards, science, education, warfare, defense, the arts, entertainment, and modulation of our climate can be readily conveyed with modern communication techniques.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> WHAT?</h2>
        <a>We are creating an extensive, easily accessed array of stories, images, videos, and music using the Internet to capture and convey all facets of Human- Ocean inter-dependencies throughout our long journey on this, and maybe other, planets. Any person with a hand-held device and access to the Internet will be able to explore these themes on their own at no cost.</a>
